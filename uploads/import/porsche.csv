Selling Points: Just completed a timing belt service and complete review of all systems by a Porsche specialist (Powertech in NJ). Everything is 100% on the car.This GTS was the last model of 928s made. There are very few GTSs remaining. This car has custom wheels and tires. Sound system includes amp and subwoofer. Maintenance records from 2001 when this owner purchased the car. 

Condition: Excellent condition. No dents. You will notice 2 accidents on the report. These were both parking lot bumps and have been completely repaired. This car has never been in a road accident.

Seller's Notes: There are a few really well preserved Porsche road cars out there, but this has got to be one of the best 928's currently available. The all-original paint is absolutely a 9 out of 10. Likewise, the interior is nearly perfect, with very supple leather, like-new wood, and fresh looking carpeting. The wheels are virtually unscathed and the bumpers unmarred. The engine starts and run smoothly with a gutteral torque that can only come from a highly-tuned, robust V8. Isn't it remarkable how the V8 design has not only endured, but is currently experiencing a solid resurgence at all price levels? And where once a front-engined V8 Porsche was scorned by the Zuffenhausen cognoscenti, it seems like all the new Porsche models are what - front-engine V8s! Maybe this cars was simply too soon for it's time, and yet it drives, feels, and looks contemporary today! And as clean as this 1987 is, you will have folks stammering in disbelief is you tell them its age and how little you paid for it (I recommend you stay quiet and let them draw their own mistaken conclusions). The car has an outstanding history of careful ownership so, as you would expect, everything on the car works as it should, and the timing belt has less than 10,000 miles on it. I am confident you will find everything to be in excellent condition on this car. As I stated earlier, I seriously doubt you will find another in this condition, at these low miles, in these radiant colors at near this price! Please call Jay at 04-281-6468 to ask any questions or to schedule an appointment to see and drive. Thanks!

Seller's Notes: This is a 2 owner car that was used to drive back & forth to the beach at owner's summer home in the Hamptons since 1992, & is absolutely stunning inside and out. This model year has the 32 valve 5.0 liter motor and comes with a clean Carfax. In addition to the upgraded 993 rims and deep Pirellis on the car the original 928S rims with nearly new Pirelli summer tires are also included. The silver metallic paint looks 2 miles deep and the interior has no rips/tears; the driver's seat has some slight fading. We have full receipts totaling over $19,000 in service history spent within the last 10,000 miles of ownership from PowerTech Porsche in Rockaway NJ. Also included is the oem car cover. They rarely come in this condition and when they do they're priced $12 - $15K. Sold As-Is only because of the model year. This is a real one guys. 

Please call 877-349-2422 for more info. Thank you DONT PAY HIGH DEALER FEES ANYMORE!!! S&J AUTO IS THE ONLY CAR DEALER ON ROUTE 46 THAT OFFERS THESE LOW FEES!! OUR GUARANTEED $299.00 DEALER FEE IS ALL YOU PAY! www.sjwholesalers.com

Seller's Notes: This is a 2 owner car that was used to drive back & forth to the beach at owner's summer home in South Hampton since 1992, & is absolutely stunning inside and out. This model year has the 32 valve 5.0 liter motor and comes with a clean Carfax. No accidents or rust. In the last 10,000 miles over $22,500 was spent in servicing this car at Powertech Porsche in Rockaway, NJ.- that's correct $22,500. Timing belt & the 60,000 mile service was done at 58,000 miles. All repair orders are documented and included. In addition to the upgraded 993 rims and deep Pirellis on the car the original 928S rims with nearly new Pirelli summer tires are also included. The silver metallic paint looks 2 miles deep and the interior has no rips/tears; the driver's seat has some slight fading. They rarely come in this condition and when they do they're priced at $15K. This is a real one guys.

Selling Points: Hard to find Euro model with additional horsepower and 5speed manual transmission. Plenty of great driving weather ahead! If you value the grace and power of the Porsche flagship, get your hands on one of the few 5speeds still available, at a great price. 

Condition: Recent replacement of timing belt, air mass meter, tuneup and various other fixes makes this 928 ready for a fun driving season. This car is fast and graceful, and rewards one with an experience of exhilaration and incredible satisfaction. A few items still need attention, typical of a 25 yearold car, but nothing too major. All recent work performed at the dealer, by a 928centric professional aficionado. Paperwork available.

Seller's Notes: If you are looking for a affordable European sports classic this car is for you. It drives like a dream and is an example of Porsche's entry into to the gran touring market. With its passive rear steering this car can corner! You won't regret buying this car at a great price. A new water pump, timing belt and fuel pump were recently installed.

Seller's Notes: 1988 PORSCHE 928S4 The Porsche 928S4 is a true Supercar that features a front-mounted 32 valve 5.0 Liter double overhead cam V-8 that puts out 316 HP. Porsche's unique design features a torque tube connecting the engine to a rear-mounted 5-speed transaxle for optimum balance and handling. The luxurious leather-trimmed cabin is incredibly comfortable for two adults, with occasional seating for two more passengers. On the German Autobahns a 928 was the ideal car to cruise comfortably at 100+ mph for hours on end. This stunning Red 928S4 with Tan leather is one of the best maintained and preserved examples we have ever had the pleasure to offer. With only two owners and extremely low miles, this car looks and drives as nearly-new. The climate control AC blows cold and all the power accessories and instruments function properly. The car has never been modified or abused, and even the radio and speakers remain factory original. When Porsche designed the 928 they started with a clean sheet of paper and produced a car intended to eclipse even the venerable 911. Contemporary road tests lauded the design, and this stunning example will give its new owner the most satisfying comfort and performance. - Exotic Classics specializes in a superior product at a fair price. All of our vehicles are hand selected to appeal to the quality oriented buyer. Our staff is well versed in Exotic, Collectible and Premier vehicles.

Seller's Notes: 1984 PORSCHE 928SExotic Classics is pleased to present this superb 1984 Porsche 928S. Until recently this Porsche was a Southern California car having been purchased new at Beverly Hills Porsche by an Emmy-winning television executive. The owner was a true enthusiast who bound and kept all of his service and repair receipts. I have not seen the equal of this cars history file, and the new owner will have the opportunity to add to this cars provenance. There are no deferred maintenance issues and most services have been stamped in the book with receipts to match. The car includes all of the original books and tools as well as many spares. The car is presented in platinum metallic paint and has never been damaged. The optional brown full-leather interior is as-new. Options include the electric sliding roof and upgraded sound system with additional amplifier. The car drives great on test and the manual transmission is a delight. Look closely and notice that the car has never been modified or molested in any way. Porsche enthusiasts are recognizing the best 928s as desirable collectibles and this is surely one of them. Your personal inspection is invited.

Vehicle History Report 




Seller's Notes: The Porsche 928 first debuted in 1978. It was full of unique features and was Porsches only V8 sports car. The 5.0 liter engine had an aluminum alloy block, 4 valves per cylinder, and utilized silicon alloy lined piston chambers. The transmission and differential are one unit called a trans-axle and this is located in the rear of the vehicle giving a perfect 50-50 weight distribution which greatly aids handling and braking. It weighs almost 3500 pounds, does 0-60 MPH in 6 seconds, 151 MPH top end, the Weissach rear axle that also aids in cornering, and the very efficient designed engine of 1.04 HP/ cu.in. making 320HP, make this collector car very desirable to own and drive. The 1987 928 S4 had updated pistons, cylinder heads, camshafts, intake, and larger intake valves from the prior year. The new style front and rear bumpers and light assemblies were also new for the 1987 928 S4. With the mainly galvanized steel body and aluminum door skins, front fenders and hood this car utilized extensive innovation from Porsche for this car. This pristine example has been well cared for and maintained. This vehicle also has 8 way power adjustable seats left and right, rear spoiler, rear window wiper, chrome rims, sun roof, alpine radio and climate control.

Seller's Notes: This 944 S2 Cabriolet is the perfect weekend car for that cruise through the mountains this fall or a quick trip to the beach. In excellent condition comes equipped with Manual 5 speed transmission, black leather, am/fm stereo, all owners manuals, complete set of carpet mats, and a car cover. At this price anyone can afford this Porsche 944 S2 Cab and have a great weekend sports car. As brokers, we buy and sell hundreds of vehicles each month, allowing us to find and offer a very select few. Because we receive our vehicles from premium dealers in the area (LEXUS, MERCEDES, PORSCHE, LAND ROVER and other luxury stores), we have access to cars in exceptional condition before they enter the retail market. Our wholesale position in the market affords us the opportunity to buy and sell these select vehicles without the overhead most dealers experience, and provide you with a better car priced below retail stores.

Selling Points: Always garage stored each winter. Well loved and cared for. Replaced breaks and break pads, timing belt and balance shaft belt, and clutch slave and master cylinders. Comes with intact jack, Porsche tool set, extra oil filters, and fitted soft cover. 

Condition: Small dings and scratches on the lower front end as expected from normal wear and tear. Some corrosion on the exhaust pipe. The only real issues are: 1. The rubber spoiler is detaching from the rear window. Its not a difficult fix for the right person. 2. The tires need to be replaced to pass inspection. Neither of these are tough, theyre just not worth while for me right now. Engine runs flawlessly. Paint is original and in excellent condition. All glass is flawless with no cracks or scratches.

Selling Points: 1986 Porsche 944 Turbo, 98,500 miles. The car is in great shape, better than any other 944 I have seen on the road. Dashboard is in great shape, the rest of the interior is terrific as well. Everything works on this car. This is a super fast car (060 in 5.7 seconds) handles better than most cars on the road today.I found this car at a Porsche mechanic near my home. He recommended it due to its well preserved condition and that he knew its history since the second owner bought it. It was sitting in his garage for 3 years and it started on the first try after all that time. Because I am a perfectionist, I have done a lot of work on it and it is VERY reliable. 

Condition: The car is stock with the exception of the radio (brand new Sony unit with iPhone/iPod, Pandora and Bluetooth.) Also has a Power Authority chip bringing horsepower up to 230. New timing belt, tensioners, guides, hoses, power steering pump, water pump, new seals, new oil pan gasket, new lower control arms and bushings, New rear axles (it has the much coveted Limited Slip Diff)...yes I spent a great deal of money perfecting the mechanical condtion. Unfortunately, now the wife is really pushing me to sell. You must see the car to believe the great condition and experience the ride.

Seller's Notes: ACCIDENT-FREE HISTORY! JUST SERVICED! Very clean Porsche 944: 5-speed manual transmission, alloy wheels, power windows, CD player, cold air conditioning, and a lot more. This Porsche runs very well and is in overall good condition. It's not a show car but a fine daily driver or toy.

Seller's Notes: TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CLASSIC. THIS 944 ONLY HAS 62070 MILES ON IT. IT IS A 5 SPEED AND HAS A/C AND POWER WINDOWS. STOP BY AND SEE THIS IN PERSON, YOU DO NOT SEE THESE VERY OFTEN. WAS PRICED AT $8,995.00 NOW SALE PRICED AT ONLY $7,980.00 ! THAT IS A LOT OF CAR FOR THE PRICE, AND A GREAT CHANCE TO OWN A PORSCHE . We have been in business since 1959 and safety inspect our cars and also put warranties on them. We are NOT your typical used car dealer.

Seller's Notes: Classic Porsche in WAY above average condition! Freshly serviced in our shop and ready to go! Our service department has just installed four new tires, rear brake pads & rotors, a new battery, oil change, and a few other miscellaneous items to make this 944 completely road ready. The body and paint is in great condition with no visible rust. All glass is in good condition and everything is in good working condition. As for upgrades, the only parts that are not OEM are the radio head unit, a performance computer chip (which raises the rev limiter, gives it a few more HP, and MUCH better throttle response over the factory naturally-aspirated 944s), and the transmission was swapped with a tougher transmission from a 944 Turbo. This is a great example of a 944! For any more information, feel free to email Alex Vorderman from Vorderman Motor Werks at alexv@vordermanvw.com. Our Certified Pre-Owned VW's are inspected and certified by factory trained technicians. Only a Volkswagen dealer can offer a used VW with VOLKSWAGEN CERTIFIED coverage!

Seller's Notes: Auto Assets is please to make available this 1987 Porsche 944. The 944 was considered a benchmark car at its introduction. The idea for a transaxle chassis design was used by Porsche to give the 944 exceptional driving dynamics and superb balance, unlike the 944 Turbo offerings which can overpower the chassis. A 944 is a car that is a delight to drive and a well driven 944 without the lag of the turbo cars can be a rewarding drive indeed. This car is has been driven approximately 15,000 miles in the past 6 years. This is an excellent example of the 944 Porsche, well above average condition both inside and out. The tires have full tread, newish all season tires on Factory Phone Dial Wheels. This is a very sharp and eye catching Porsche. The car drives very smooth. The 5 speed transmission shifts through the gears effortlessly. This car is a lot of fun to drive. The previous owner has taken care of this vehicle and it shows. Our service department has attended to this944s immediate needs. We are pleased to report that this car sports a clean Carfax car history report. This is a very nice example of a late 80s Porsche. This car is equipped with power pop up sunroof, 4 way power driver seat, ICE cold air conditioning, original Blaupunkt Radio, Timing Belt Maintenance stamps in the engine compartment, and all of the original floor mats, Books, Keys, Air Compressor and Plastic Coveralls. The Right Front fender is missing some paint on the edge where someone got too close to something. The back of the car has been professionally resprayed in the factory LY1Y Almond Beige Metallic and the preparation work was to a high standard. The color match is excellent. No we do not know why it was repainted, we can only inspect the quality of the work and report that it is very good. All of the original seams are intact and it does not appear to have suffered anything more than a minor scuff. We have complete confidence in the structural integrity of th A different kind of dealership. We specialize in European performance, high end, collector and special interest cars. All cars come with 6 months discounted service and parts at our service facility. In business since 1990, Auto Assets is by enthusiasts and for enthusiasts.

Condition: 1987 Porsche 944 S ~72k original miles, currently my daily driver Excellent condition inside and out; good or better for age. Owned and maintained before me by PCA member and respected doctor in a small town since ~26k miles, he passed away, the estate sold the car. Only selling because my fifth child on the way is encouraging my own growing up. No major issues or stories, this is a pleasure to own and drive. Very smooth, shifts well, clutch strong, feels exactly as it should.

Seller's Notes: We have one of the nicest Porsche 944s that you will find on the road. This car is in amazing shape and looks absolutely beautiful. You will love how this Porsche looks thanks to the gorgeous FUCHS 911 rims that are black with a polished lip and of course the windows are tinted to give it a slightly more aggressive appearance! When you come to look at it you will be able to tell right away that it was loved and cared for. The body and paint are in excellent condition and you are sure to get a ton of compliments. This Porsche has a 5-speed manual transmission and a sport tuned, fuel injected engine that makes the car a blast to drive! It shifts smoothly and the clutch feels great. Porsche designed the car to have a nearly perfect 50/50 weight distribution so it handles extremely well and feels very solid. This will be one of the most fun cars you will ever own! A very cool feature about this 944 is the huge sunroof that can be easily removed and stores away in the hatch. It is great for cruising around town or out in the country; it lets the sun shine in and a little breeze as well. Not only does this car look great on the outside but the interior looks great as well. The seats are extremely comfortable to sit in and provide plenty of leg room for taller drivers. We know you will love driving this Porsche and it will make the perfect summer car to take out on nice days to cruise the town with! To make sure this car runs as nice as it looks, we have had it inspected by an independent company. They are very thorough and check all of the vehicle systems, fluids, brakes, tires, and engine to make sure there are no surprises when you buy it. If you have any questions or you are considering trading your current vehicle in please call us anytime. We sell a wide variety of motor vehicles and are happy to answer any questions you might have. Feel free to check out our inventory often. We always have something new!

Selling Points: Hello I am looking to sell my Porsche 944. This is a great car and runs top notch. My kids are getting to big to ride in the back so I need to get a bigger car. The car has power windows, mirrors, and power removable moon roof. Over the past year I have put in a new half shaft 750.00 and a new clutch 2300.00. All parts used is OEM Porsche so they will last a great amount of time. Comes with a Bra and Mirror Bras as well. Has a Panasonic ghost face MP3 radio in it. The drivers seat has a rip in it. The 5speed shifts great. I cant say enough good things about this car. I am firm on the price as over 3000.00 has been just put into it. Have receipts for the work preformed.

Seller's Notes: This is being sold as a running car... but barely. Starts, Runs, Idles. Needs a clutch slave and master.... maybe much more... Has good oil pressure. Has a set of 15 Fuchs wheels - they alone are worth $800-$1500 depending on who you ask. I have enough Fuchs so buy these wheels for $1800 and get the car for free. As is. No Warranty. Strictly sold AS IS.... We purchased it thinking we would build a 944 Spec Racer.... and changed minds... A different kind of dealership. We specialize in European performance, high end, collector and special interest cars. All cars come with 6 months discounted service and parts at our service facility. In business since 1990, Auto Assets is by enthusiasts and for enthusiasts. Visit our website www.autoassets.com for more information.

A true find to a `coming classic. Smells brand new and drives just the way it is suppose to from 1989. Grab one of these `true finds while they are still available and affordable. Porsche does not and can not build them like this anymore.This 1989 Porsche is probably the best 1989 944 in the United States, It has won many Porsche Club America first place finishes, both local and regional events.

Seller's Notes: This Porsche Carrera GT is 1 of only 980 vehicles ever made. This is the ultimate collector car,  flawless in and out. Red over black, with a manual transmission.Any car can take you from one place to another. But not many can go from zero to 60 miles per hour (97 kph) in just over three seconds or hit a top speed of 205 mph (330 kph). And not many cars feel as at home on the racetrack as they do on the roadway. The V10, 605-horsepower Porsche Carrera GT achieves all of the above.Inspected by our Factory Trained Technicians this car has passed with flying colors. Do not hesitate, if you have been looking for the right Carrera GT, this is it. They do not come around often.100% CARFAXCERTIFIED!!!
