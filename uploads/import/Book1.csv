Seller's Notes: AWD, DVD, and XM NavTraffic. Here it is! What a fantastic deal! When was the last time you smiled as you turned the ignition key? Feel it again with this terrific 2010 Buick Enclave. With plenty of passenger room, you won't have to worry about being cramped when it's more than just you in the SUV. J.D. Power and Associates gave the 2010 Enclave 4.5 out of 5 Power Circles for Overall Initial Quality Mechanical. New Car Test Drive said it...features a modern cabin, with stylish illumination, crisp graphics, genuine wood trim and nice leather. The seats are comfortable...also offers strong acceleration and smooth highway cruising... We will never be undersold!
