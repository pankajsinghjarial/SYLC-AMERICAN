Seller's Notes: Summer's here....and this Sebring convertible will let you enjoy it with the top down! This fun-in-the-sun ride is one of the few affordable drop tops with a legitimate backseat. But this convertible does much more than just drop its top to be worth your hard-earned bucks. It delivers all around in classic Chrysler style. This car has excellent paint, seams and uniform gaps, and there are some nice, quality accent pieces that really look classy. You'll love the chrome trim on the front grill, which makes the nose pop in the sun. A walk around the Sebring finds some nicely chromed 16 aluminum wheels, fog lamps and a chrome exhaust tip. All of the exterior styling cues project a classy image. In owner reviews, ride quality is among the Sebring's strong points, as it proves both comfortable and composed at freeway speeds. The interior is well-appointed, dressed in high quality materials and intelligently laid out. The best feature is the instrument cluster, which is tucked neatly in front of the driver and echoes the deco theme of the Chrysler logo. It's clean and clear. Front seat occupants ride in roomy comfort, and rear seating can accommodate two passengers. The entire cabin design is ergonomically sound. Now then, let's put the top down! Two latches, one at each corner of the windshield, release the roof. A toggle switch in the center console sends the top up and back in quick fashion, its quiet motor doing the job without fuss. You could easily get the top down at a traffic light, evoking jealous stares. Please call 877-885-7839 for more information or to schedule a test drive.

Seller's Notes: Ever since this internet thing greatly impacted our business a few years ago I have written an ad for every single car we have listed on-line. Considering the fact we sell 70 or 80 cars per month this has become a bit of a tiresome task but I know that you want to know where our cars come from and what we do to make sure you are getting the best car for your money so I keep going. I have realized recently that I truly could write a single ad for every car we sell and it would cover the information you need to know why you should buy your car from Johns, so here goes. I spend my days finding and buying the nicest local trades on the market. I dont buy from big national auctions and our cars havent been passed through seven different states. I buy from local new car dealers who have done business with us for years. We then take those local cars and send them through the same independent shop that has done all of our service work for over 23 years for a complete mechanical inspection. If the car needs $1,500 worth of maintenance it gets it and it is done by four of the most experienced and talented mechanics you will ever meet. My brother then spends his days helping our customers get the financing they need to buy a great car while at the same time explaining that while we give you an incredible warranty with your vehicle we have long term protection available that can save you money and stress. We have built relationships with the best lenders we can find and he will work to get you the best rate or the credit help you need. My Dad, John, then spends his days making sure that every customer who leaves our dealership is happy. If something does go wrong he handles the matter personally and you will not find a more fair and decent man to help you. Thats what we do: every car, every customer, every time. They are all Great Cars. Family owned & operated w/over 20 years experience.Conveniently located on Lancaster Ave. in Reading,PA.Handicapped Accessible w/ a comfortable waiting area. Call 888-485-9679 for more information / to schedule YOUR test drive.

Seller's Notes: Top Down, Riding in Style! This Chrysler Sebring comes from a solid family of cars, and is the Wild Child of the bunch! This Sebring is not only fun to drive, but offers a good value without sacrificing style or performance! Plus, its claim to fame is the amount of space that allows it to still serve as an everyday functional sedan. Because it is based on a sedan platform it has all the rear room as if it were a 4 door car. Unlike many other convertibles, built on a coupe platform, this Sebring does not squeeze back seat passengers which means a more comfortable ride for your family and friends! Extended warranty available! For a test drive in your NEW 2005 Chrysler Sebring call 888-274-1206 Today! Our Sebring Convertible is gorgeous inside and out! Just look at our pictures and you'll see this one was gently used and never abused! Get ready for some open air fun! Print this page and call us Now... We Know You Will Enjoy Your Test Drive Towards Ownership! Call 888-274-1206

That's why we have created the Bergstrom Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle Promise. Every Bergstrom pre-owned vehicle is 123-point inspected, reconditioned and certified to never have been deemed salvaged, flood-damaged or 'lemon law.' Why ever take the risk of buying a used vehicle from anywhere else? You are protected at Bergstrom. The Bergstrom Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle Promise can mean years and years of trouble-free driving enjoyment.

Seller's Notes: All of our pre loved vehicles are priced below the market because of our volume - nobody buys previously leased vehicles from the bank for less than us! We submit every car to a 121 point safety inspection and you can pay for it anyway you like. Many of our competitiors require you to finance the car through them to get the advertised price Legacy Infiniti in Lynbrook, NY treats the needs of each individual customer with paramount concern. We know that you have high expectations, and as a car dealer we enjoy the challenge of meeting and exceeding those standards each and every time. Allow us to demonstrate our commitment to excellence!

Seller's Notes: It is still hot out! But if you wait until next spring to buy a convertible, you could pay up to $2000 more! Buy now and save big! Still plenty of time left to enjoy it! This beautiful convertible is affordable and dependable. Already has a Maryland State Inspection, and is ready to find its new owner. Beautiful black cherry color, well maintained. Fun Ride. It won't last at this price. Still a lot of hot summer/fall days to come...hurry! We prefer to do business by appointment in order to accomodate our customer's needs. All of our vehicles are NOT at one location. Please contact us to make an appointment and to obtain proper directions to the vehicle you are interested in. We try to price our vehicles below average for a no hastle buying experience and quick turnover to keep our inventory fresh. Thank you for your interest!!

Seller's Notes: Absolutely beautiful and super clean Sebring JXi Convertible finished in Candy Apple Red over Tan Leather and Tan cloth convertible top. This car has just 88K original miles and is the top-of-the-line JXi model and loaded with all the right options and features including: Leather interior, Power cloth convertible top in great shape, 16"" alloy wheels, In-dash 6-CD changer, Fog lights, Power seat, Remote locks, and more. This car is in super clean condition throughout with no paint or interior issues and comes complete with the convertible top boot. Most definitely one of if not the cleanest, lowest mileage example for sale anywhere and fitted with the beloved 2.5L V6 engine, not the problematic 2.7L found in later models. Please visit us at our website, www.autolivery.com, for a COMPLETE description of this vehicle, including more pictures, vehicle and warranty info.

Seller's Notes: PRICE REDUCED!! TO $4995!! This is a very good running Chrysler Sebring Convertible. She is a JXi LIMITED. The interior is a Two Tone Dark Gray/Tan Leather. She is a subdued eye catcher. All power equipment is functioning properly. No defects. There is a properly functioning engine in this vehicle. I would describe the exterior condition as clean. The interior is clean and in good condition. The odometer reflects accurate mileage. This vehicle has a smooth shifting transmission. Tire wear at 50%.

Seller's Notes: CLEAN CARFAX! FREE WARRANTY! FREE LIFETIME NYS INSPECTION! 100% CREDIT APPROVAL! Sebring the sedan surprised us with its competent road manners and the tight and precise way mechanical equipment functioned. We really liked the stiff yet smooth ride characteristics and discovered through experience that Sebring could be downright nimble in navigating a set of curves, or quick to respond when prodded in the passing lane. The electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission is quiet and efficient. Gear ratios for the transmission have been calibrated to produce fast-clip getaways in stoplight derbies and typical stop-and-go in-town driving situations. Thus, the Sebring feels quick and can transform a freeway entry into an easy maneuver. THE NEW HOME OF GUARANTEED CREDIT APPROVAL! Here at Payrite Auto Sales everyone drives. You work, we can get you approved. Help us, help you. Call TODAY!

Seller's Notes: New Brakes!! Arlington Toyota & Scion is honored to present a wonderful example of pure vehicle design... this 2002 Chrysler Sebring only has 122,879 miles on it and could potentially be the vehicle of your dreams! The CARFAX report for this 2002 Sebring highlights that it's a One-Owner vehicle, and for good reason. A One-Owner vehicle gives you the feel of owning a new vehicle without paying the new car price. The Sebring is well maintained and has just 122,879 miles. This low amount of miles makes this vehicle incomparable to the competition. Although this 2002 Sebring is technically a pre-owned vehicle, the clean and spotless interior could fool even the toughest critic. Driven by many, but adored by more, the Sebring is a perfect addition to any home. All pre-driven vehicles have passed a rigorous mechanical and safety inspection by our certified technicians. Most pre-owned vehicle is backed with a warranty! All information is gathered from sources that are believed to be reliable, but we cannot assume any responsibility for errors or omissions or warrant the accuracy of this information.

Seller's Notes: We purchased this vehicle with a bad motor, and installed a younger (89K) motor in it. Since this is one of those motors that has to have the timing belt changed at 100K miles, we went ahead and installed a new belt, water pump, tensioner, etc. in the replacement motor. IN OTHER WORDS, this car has had all of the maintenance it will need for a LONG, LONG time. Very attractive dark blue exterior, with light charcoal cloth inside which is in very good condition. As with all our Certified vehicles, this has been subjected to our extensive 120-144 point inspection process. We will be happy to show you the checklist as well as the repair order showing what we did to rectify any discrepencies that did not measure up to our precise, written standards. For more photos and information, please visit our website at www.certifiedcarsofbelton.com for a great selection of quality pre-loved cars, trucks, vans, and SUVs Also, please know that we have an outstanding service department offering a full range of automotive repair services.

Seller's Notes: According to the CARFAX REPORT in addition to our own 49 POINT SAFETY/MECHANICAL INSPECTION, we are confident this 2004 Chrysler Sebring is not only a GREAT FUEL EFFICIENT SEDAN, but also a GREAT VALUE. Whether commuting for school, work or play...traversing Colorado's scenic mountain roads...or just a nice night out on the town...this Sebring is perfect for the job. Treat yourself while making a sound economic decision as well! Your interest in a quality pre-owned vehicle from Flatirons Hyundai of Boulder is greatly appreciated.

Seller's Notes: Drop the top and have some fun in the sun with this meticulously taken care of convertible that begs to be driven and enjoyed. Owned by only two previous drivers, the odometer reflects average annual usage less than 8400 miles per year. You'll save in the front and save at the pump too as this peppy 2.5 liter V-6 achieves highway mpg in the mid 20's! Leather interior and stunning alloy wheel only begin to tell the story of this sharp driver's car. Take advantage and take a test drive today!

Seller's Notes: DRASTICLY DISCOUNTED!!! $3999 It's summer time. BUT, Crysler knows how to build a convertible, with its cloth inner-lining, its like a hard top, not a rag top! FWD, good all year-round! This is a beautiful automobile, power everything, automatic and A/C. Want a sporty, fun to drive car? LOW MILES, BETTER QUIT WAITING! Because the car you looked at today and want to think about until tomarrow, may be the same car someone else looked at yesterday and will buy today! CALL ME!!!

Seller's Notes: This Chrysler Sebring is an excellent value for the money. With only 106,080 miles on the odometer, you can be assured of many years of great service ahead. The previous owner was a non-smoker, which is a definite plus. You can count on the 2.7 Liter 6 Cylinder engine to get great gas mileage and go the distance between fill ups. 

The powerful 2.7 Liter 6 Cylinder engine accelerates strongly and more than holds its own in the toughest of traffic. The sports tuned suspension hugs the road like nobody's business. The interior of this ride is nothing less than perfect and is a sign of the excellent care and attention that this vehicle has seen since it was new. Everything under the hood is in perfect shape thanks to our multi-point inspection that every vehicle undergoes. 

Overall, the exterior is in really good shape with just a few insignificant blemishes in the finish that aren't even noticeable from a short distance.

Seller's Notes: This 2002 Chrysler Sebring is the perfect car for the buyer looking for a car that is ready to go, and has the sex appeal and comfort that one finds in a luxury vehicle. All power controls and leather make this car comfortable and convenient. The reputable name of Chrysler and sturdy build of the Sebring make this car exactly what any buyer is looking is looking for, a reliable vehicle that looks like a millions bucks, for way less than a million bucks. 3,700 dollars can't even buy you a new golf-cart, but at Phoenix it will buy you years of driving around the beautiful roads of Ohio in a gorgeous Sebring. Starts right up, drives great, and feels exciting. Call today before someone beats you to it!

Seller's Notes: This 2001 Chrysler Sebring is offered to you for sale by Jenkins Auto Sales. There is still plenty of tread left on the tires. This vehicle is fully-loaded. Some minor wear on the driver's side seat, which is typical for these vehicles, but otherwise in excellent condition. The transmission in this vehicle shifts very smoothly. All interior components are in good working order. A Sebring in this condition, with these options and this color combination is an absolute rarity! This vehicle is priced to sell. Jenkins Auto Sales is excited to offer this 2001 Chrysler Sebring for only $3590! Please call Sales 888-737-8755

Selling Points: Really good looking car with very low mileage. Incredibly clean. Wood effect dash trim with cruise control and power seats. Outside temperature and compass display. This car has been well maintained, has been serviced every 3,000 miles and has low mileage. Premium wheels enhance its aleady sporty look and with its V6 engine it has plenty of power and pick up. There is lots of storage in the center console and the trunk is very spacious. Kelly Blue Book Value is $4,400. I recently moved to California from Texas and purchased a new car that gets better MPG. I love this car. I inherited this car from my mother when she passed and I hate to sell it, but I cant afford two cars. 

Condition: Excellent interior condition. Exterior condition very good with only a couple of required touchup areas and a couple of very tiny dings. This car has been involved in a couple of minor fender benders requiring only body work and has suffered no other damage. Transmission was rebuilt two years ago. Needs new fuel pump ($300 plus labor). Air conditioner needs minor work. Tires were replaced September 2011. Engine mounts were recently replaced as were headlight lamp covers. Windshield has a crack that is not in need of immediate repair but windshield can be replaced for $200. This is a great car.
