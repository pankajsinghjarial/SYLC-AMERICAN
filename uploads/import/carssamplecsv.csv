Freed. Where to begin with all the amazing features: the Honda Factory Performance (HFP) 18 alloy wheels are wrapped in 215/40-ZR18-85W performance tires. A full HFP aero kit that includes front, side and rear underbody spoilers and a Carbon Fiber Seibon MG hood lightens the overall weight. The dazzling Lambo-style scissor doors always attract a crowd. To bring this one-off Si to a stop is a set of 13 Brembro Calipers clamping down on cross-drilled rotors. Handling also gets an assist from an HFP suspension kit both front and rear. Extra power is pulled from the already potent Si engine by a HFP cat-back exhaust system. The entire exterior of this car is custom painted and pinstriped with a two-tone paint job and custom barbwire accents. The real beauty of this car is in the interior. A complete in-car entertainment system that includes a Mac Mini, a full touch-screen monitor, while the rear seating has been replaced with an amp/battery rack, and a flat screen TV. Audio is sourced through a Kenwood Receiver and plays beautifuly through a custom sound system with center channel speakers. This amazing Civic Si will make a statement wherever you go, and you dont have to worry about anyone having the same Civic as yours!",,,http://www.cstatic-images.com/phototab/DMI/7989/H64651.jpg,http://www.cstatic-images.com/phototab/DMI/7989/H64651.02.jpg,"$29,995 ","1,248",Gasoline,Coupe,2.0L I4 16V MPFI DOHC,Navy Blue,6-Speed Manual,Black,H64651,FWD,2HGFG21516H702958,2,"104""",http://www.cars.com/go/search/detail.jsp?tracktype=usedcc&csDlId=&csDgId=&listingId=84373489&listingRecNum=2&criteria=sf1Dir%3DDESC%26mkId%3D20017%26stkTyp%3DU%26mdId%3D20823%26rd%3D100000%26crSrtFlds%3DstkTypId-feedSegId-mkId-mdId%26zc%3D36117%26rn%3D0%2,,,

This 2010 Honda Civic is the best car for you if you believe economy cars warrant precision engineering and forward-thinking design. This eighth-generation Civic brings to the small-car field an artsy sense of design inside and out. No rival has quite matched it for sophisticated good taste. Our EX coupe upgrades with 16-inch wheels, adds auxiliary audio controls to the steering wheel, and includes rear disc brakes, a power sunroof, variable-speed windshield wipers, and an outside-temperature gauge. From behind the wheel, an efficient design means our EX compact is among the lightest-weight cars in the class, so the 140-horsepower engine satisfies most any daily driving demand. It can change direction quickly with excellent balance, paradigms of small-car handling. This car delivers high style, a roomy cabin, and advanced features. Lively performance and great fuel economy are on the agenda as well! Scholfield Honda - Used Cars You Love! Scholfield Honda's EXCLUSIVE 7 Year / 100,000 mile Power-train Warranty on all NEW HONDA'S.

This Civic features a 2.0L i-VTEC 4 cylinder and a sporty 6 speed close ratio manual transmission. This is a very popular car and won't be here long. Carfax gave it a clean history report and we gave it a new Virginia state inspection. Not only is this car fast and fun to drive but it gets great fuel mileage. This SI is priced under Kelly Blue Book retail. This Civic also has the pre-owned Honda certification on it which gives you more warranty and peace of mind knowing it was thoroughly inspected to meet Honda's strict specifications.

If you want an amazing deal on an amazing car that will not break your pocket book, then take a look at this fuel-efficient 2009 Honda Civic. The pin-you-to-your-seat performance of this superb Civic will make it a favorite among our more passionate buyers. New Car Test Drive said, ...We found ride quality in the Civic solid but not overly firm, with less road noise and wind whistle than is common for the class. The stiff chassis gives the Civic a solid and planted feel, with impressive stability and responsive steering, while the relatively long wheelbase smoothes the ride... It is nicely equipped. Designated by Consumer Guide as a Compact Car Best Buy in 2009. Each vehicle in our inventory was purchased directly from its prior owner. This means we learn the full history of each vehicle before we decide to purchase it (versus most dealers who are making decisions in a matter of seconds as the vehicle passes by them at an auction). We are conveniently located in the Mission Valley Auto Circle, on the south side of Interstate 8 between Texas Street and Mission Center Drive.

A Every single salesperson in our organization is Non-commissioned. I hate talking with commissioned salespeople...typically their focus isn't on me and what I am trying to accomplish. Typically they are focusing on the thing that will earn them the largest profit. I want my salespeople to be able to speak the buyer's language and build relationships with each and every one of our guests. Each of my salespeople are paid a salary and incentives for things way more important than money...like giving you the best buying experience ever at a dealership. Q I like you, I like your dealership and I like your prices. I don't think I can qualify for your financing. Do you have other options available? A I believe everyone should have more than one option. We have financing options for every buyer. I hate going somewhere and finding out I don't qualify for their special rates and they have nothing else for me. Each of my salespeople has been trained to help you find the rates and terms you deserve. - All of my people are trained to speak the buyer's language and build relationships with every one of our guests. Each of my salespeople is non-commissioned, which means they are paid a salary and incentives for things way more important than money...like giving you the best buying experience ever.
