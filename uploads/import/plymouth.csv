Seller's Notes: The big news for 1968 A-bodies was the Super Stock 426 Hemi package, available in the Dart and Barracuda; around 50 of the latter were produced. This was a drag race only package, featuring a race-tuned Hemi and a seriously lightened body with acid-dipped doors, Lexan in place of glass, factory delete of anything not essential to life on the drag strip (e.g. back seat, sound deadener, window cranks). They had a little sticker which indicated that the car was not for use on public highways, but for ""supervised acceleration trials"" only. Running into the low to mid 8 seconds these cars dominated the top NHRA Super Stock classes (SS/A and SS/AA). Super stock was not for everyone but for the people that were involved it was EVERYTHING. Ed Miller actually raced this particular B029 in 1968 and was the original owner of this car. The history alone behind this car is so significant to the Super Stock Heritage. Just being able to race side by side with Sox & Martin must have been a true honor. Just imagine going up against the Ford Drivers Don Nicholson or Hubert Platt or against Chevy Drivers like Dave Strictler or Bill Grumpy Jenkins but more importantly running up against legendary cars such as the Boss 429s, Mach Is or the COPO Camaros or the rare Yenkos. But theres something that Plymouth had that would send chills up the spines of Ford and Chevy racers.It was the HEMI !! And could this Hemi see the sky!! You are viewing a true 1968 Plymouth Barracuda Super Stock B029 car. Was born with the Hemi Engine from the factory and now its the SS/AA spec Hemi built by legendary Ray Barton. (approx. $40k-$60k+). Ray Barton was known for extracting over 900 horses out of his engines. Let me say it again this is a real B029 68 Plymouth Barracuda Super Stock Car. This particular Cuda has been a popular West Coast competitor and made its way up to North BC and over to us in the North East. And over the LRA Enterprises is your one stop shop for everything Automotive! We offer: 1st Inspection and Emmissions Fees Free Financing Call us today for a test drive!! 877-835-2161!!

Seller's Notes: 1970 Plymouth hemicuda 472ci Hemi engine, all new parts TREMEC 5 speed manual A/C, power steering and disc brakes Rotisserie restored and purple everywhere! LOADED with desirable options! Original Los Angeles-built car All receipts from build! Some cars are born stars. The right colors, the right engines, the right options. They're bought for big money and kept in vaults. We sell those, so we're not knocking them one bit--they're simply for a different purpose. This car wasn't one of the chosen: Sand Pebble Beige with black body protection strips, a 318 2bbl and shift on the column automatic, and a dark green bench seat interior...this was one ugly duckling! Just like in the story, though, this one became a beautiful swan, and it's got HEMI power to boot! Start outside where you're looking at a very clean color change to one of Mopar's best, In-Violet (or Plum Crazy for the Dodge folks,) code FC7. Of course, nothings going to grab your attention like that big hole in the hood. Sure, Ford put shakers on the Mustang, but only Chrysler would cut one big enough to double as an escape hatch for the engine! The hoods steel, too and not one of those flimsy fiberglass jobs. The grille up front has been masterfully restored and the road lights are excellent reproductions. Sliding down the sides youll find the brand new Hemi callout stripes on the massaged sides. New door handles, a new antenna and buffed and polished window trim enhance the very purple scheme from nose to tail. The bumpers sport excellent chrome, while the dual mirrors went body color. The Go-Wing on the trunk, excellent taillights, a refinished tail panel and dual chrome exhaust tips stick out of the `Cuda lower valance round out the rear view. New rallye wheels with BFGoodrich Radial T/As (235/60 front and 255/60/15 rear) tires finish off what would have been a dream order sheet! Inside, youll spend your time sitting on restored black buckets--theyre the most visible part R&H Collectibles is a private collection of fine automobiles including classic, muscle, custom hot rods and sports cars. All of our vehicles are kept in an secure, indoor, climate controlled facility. They are checked and maintained regularly to ensure they are in top condition.

Seller's Notes: Call 888-740-1824 or email sales@mcgohio.com 1968 Plymouth GTX Numbers matching All original sheetmetal 440 Super Commando, Four speed Highly detailed Copies of all original paperwork Plymouth's executive express--the GTX. The Road Runner's better looking and better equipped brother and the Fury's smaller cousin had both the looks and the power to carry you in comfort and tear up the quarter mile. You want to find one just like this, with all original, clean sheetmetal and the original 440 and four speed combo. Documents first. We have a binder full of photocopies of the original paperwork. Yes, this struck us as odd, as well, but we were told the originals were lost to theft. The original fender tag is in place, and there are so few options on the car that there simply isn't much to verify, anyway. Of the copies, we have the broadcast sheet, Certicard, bill of sale, window sticker and the fender tag. We also have the salesman's worksheet (buyer's proposal) he filled out with the customer, warranty information, and even a 1 cent PAL bubble gum wrapper that was left in the interior on assembly day in late 1967! Line workers were notorious for using new cars as trash cans, since cars built in this era were designed to last three to five years. Original owner Don Pankratz took delivery on January 3, 1968, from local dealer Southtown Chrysler-Plymouth in Bloomington, MN, nearly three months after ordering the car. The buyer's proposal shows he was thinking of trading his '63 Impala SS towards it, but the bill of sale shows an all-cash deal. Don wanted plain black wheels, but since cars with standard dog dish caps came equipped with body color wheels, the car shipped from St. Louis with deluxe, full wheel covers. We have copies of early photos of the car sans any cap, so it looks like the dealer kept the covers--there's no mention of them on the bill of sale. Under the hood is the original, highly detailed and numbers matching engine. Cooling dut R&H Collectibles is a private collection of fine automobiles including classic, muscle, custom hot rods and sports cars. All of our vehicles are kept in an secure, indoor, climate controlled facility. They are checked and maintained regularly to ensure they are in top condition. This collection inventory is constantly changing. Please contact us for an appointment and private showing.

Seller's Notes: Call 888-740-1824 or email sales@mcgohio.com 1970 Plymouth GTX I can't think of a job I would have rather had at a muscle car-era carmaker than working at the sales bank. Others would have the glory of bolting the ultra-quick machines together, some would work in design and more yet would work for powertrain. So, why sales bank? They got to spec out 90% of the cars that rolled off the factory floor! If it wasn't ordered by a customer, you were responsible for filling dealership car lots. Imagine passing a car that YOU had influence over, with the satisfaction of a customer evident by the grin on their face! Here's a real beauty, done justice by the sales bank before shipping up north to Canada: Numbers matching engine and transmission Classic burnt orange and white paint scheme 440 Super Commando engine with 375hp 15 rallye wheels and BFGoodrich tires Brand new Moser Dana 60 axle Clean and straight bodywork Flowmaster rumble, big block torque! Burnt Orange is one of my favorite colors, especially on Chargers and GTX's. It's a classy hue, fitting the lines and missions of those cars. Yes, you can get a lime green or purple one, but that's ignoring the upscale mission of the GTX. Another reason to like it? If you've got one, and people ask you the color, you don't say Deep Burnt Orange Metallic. You say FK5, and Mopar people know EXACTLY what you mean. It's a color so cool, its initials alone speak for it! All by itself, FK5 can get a little heavy handed. That's what makes this car so special: There's plenty of white to balance out the rich color. White stripes, a white top and a white interior bring a balance so many muscle cars lack. There are few other options sprinkled on...read below: VIN: RS23: Plymouth GTX 2 Door Hardtop U0G: 440 375HP 4BBL V8, 1970 model year, St. Louis, MO assembly 225747: Sequence number Fender tag, top to bottom: M21: Roof drip rail moldings R11: AM Radio (2 whole watts of audio R&H Collectibles is a private collection of fine automobiles including classic, muscle, custom hot rods and sports cars.

Seller's Notes: Styled in homage to the wildly popular 1930s hi-boy hot rods, the Plymouth Prowler boasts styling unlike anything else on the road. With just 960 miles, example is one of, if not the lowest-mile Prowler available in the country. The previous owner was so enamored by this Prowler that he displayed it in his living room, only driving it for special occasions. It remains completely as ordered in Prowler Orange with leather seats, auto-dimming rear-view mirror, center-mounted instruments and an Autometer tach has been installed on the steering column. A stout 253hp 3.5L V6 powers this Plymouth through 17-inch chrome wheels and a black soft top with heated glass rear window hides neatly in the trunk when retracted. The original $45,000 window sticker is included along with the owners books, spare key, service records, CarFax and a 71-point. Prowlers are fast becoming a collectible commodity and this example, with the extremely low mileage and desirable features, looks to be a solid investment down the road.

Seller's Notes: 2 Owner/46,575 Original Miles!!Correct 383 Commando V8 w/ 4spdOriginal Red Interior, Spare, & Jack1 of 933 4 Speed Cars for ?65The Plymouth Satellite was part of the Belvedere line and was considered to be the top of the line. This Satellite was owned by the first owner until 2006 when it was passed on and later treated to an exterior restoration. When the car was painted, they retained the original color of Ruby Red and applied a new White Vinyl Roof and both are in like new condition! The original interior was detailed and reinstalled because of its near perfect condition. Being a Satellite, this car had more amenities than most, with options like the Bucket Seats, Full length console, AM Transaudio Radio, Padded Dash and Rear Arm Rest, Upgraded Seat Belts, Variable Speed Wipers with Washer, and the Light Group Package including Back-Up, Trunk, Parking Brake, and Glove Box lights.There were a few engine options available on the ?65 and the original owner chose wisely. This Satellite came with the 383 Commando V8 which put out 330 Horsepower and a whopping 425 lbs of Torque! Paired with the super rare 4 speed transmission and the 3:23 Super Grip rear end , this Satellite was a Wolf in Sheep?s clothing! All that power was spent through a true dual exhaust that was also brought back to factory specs.This Satellite truly drives like the day it was born in January of ?65. The optioned Suspension Package with Firm Ride Shocks keeps the car planted at speed but comfortable when cruising. The engine starts and runs effortlessly, until the secondary?s open up and the 425 lbs of torque roar to life! The transmission Shifts crisply and directly through all gears, thanks to the Hurst shifter.A thorough TLD service and inspection has just been performed to make sure that this car meets our strict standards. This Plymouth is one of the finest examples of a ?65 Satellite out there today. Don?t miss the opportunity to own a true piece For more information on the North Shores Finest cars, call 888-675-2358 or see www.thelastdetail.com

Seller's Notes: Here?s a limited production Plymouth Prowler for your consideration. The introduction of this sports car shocked the industry and its unique styling made this car a huge hit with Hot Rod enthusiasts. Less than 4,000 Prowlers were produced in 1999 and engine power increased up to 253HP. The car features a 3.5L H.O. V6 24V MPI engine mated to a 4-Speed Automatic with AutoStick sport shifting. All Prowlers came standard with chrome wheels and 4-Wheel Disc Brakes. Other features include A/C, 6-Disc CD player, power windows, leather seats, leather wrapped steering wheel, keyless entry, dual exhaust and much more. 

The Prowler will always be an iconic and highly desired vehicle. This car is 100% original, purchased new in 1999, with only 6K miles and comes with original window sticker. The triple black color palette is very desirable and makes this car look even meaner. Don?t miss out on this opportunity - enjoy a car that will turn heads and never again be duplicated!

Seller's Notes: The Prowler successfully captured a 1930s era design and brought it forward for a new generation for hot rod fans. That design was based on the ""Hemisfear"" an earlier project created by Chrysler designer Chip Foose who never was given full credit for the vehicle. This gorgeous roadster only has 7k miles and is in carefully owned condition.

Selling Points: Its a 1999 Red Prowler with 2590 original miles. It has been garage kept its entire life, and it shows. Its never seen rain, and its been babied by myself, along with the previous owners. The car comes with a ton of additional goodies, both installed and uninstalled.Highlights include...Mopar trailer hitch with wiring harness (still in OEM packaging)...OEM 1999 Owners Manual (still in the plastic) with CD...Original Parts Book...Original Service Manual...2 Sets of Keys with Remotes...Original window sticker in MINT condition, and laminated...3 Sets of floormats (1 still in original OEM Packaging)...Chrome shift bezel out of a 2000 Prowler (along with the stock flat black one)... and much more...I can guarantee you this; pics do not do this car justice. It is immaculate, and turns heads everywhere it goes. Clean title in hand. 

Condition: The car is like brand new. Still has original tires with not one single flaw on them. Not one scrape on the nose. It is extremely clean.

OCTOBER CUSTOMER TESTIMONIAL: S.J. - Overall, it was a good experience. Dave, from Finance was very helpful getting me the best financing I could get. I didn't feel any pressure from the dealer to buy. I do feel like they had my best interest at heart. My only con is that I had to come back to get the back seat to fold down, but the labor was of course taken care, so I can't be mad about that. We are a no pressure, no hassle Dealership. Family owned for more than 30 years and delivering to our customers some of the best used vehicles available. We encourage you to check us out online and see for yourself at www.sanrafaelmitsubishi.com

Seller's Notes: Serious about performance in 1969, Plymouth was upgrading the Barracuda as a serious contender to be reckoned with. This Cuda is optioned with a 340 V8 pushing easily 275 hp. This is a definate classic among the year 69 and will always be. Grab this great deal today before it's gone and remember these cars just go up in value with age. Eastern North Carolina's Premier Pre-owned Dealership. Family owned and operated since 1976. The Best Selection and Great service.

Seller's Notes: It is our pleasure to present a rare and well-maintained 1971 Plymouth Valiant Scamp that was meant to motor. This Mopar remains in excellent mechanical condition and finished in the original Sherwood Green metallic paint that sets it farther apart. This is a reliable and quick cruiser that can be driven anywhere at anytime. It is a great car for the weekend car shows or a summer cruise to the local ice cream shop. 

The drivetrain features a 2003 360 (5.9L) Magnum (originally a 318) with all stock internals and converted holly carb. It has a March billet Serpentine belt drive, MSD Digital 6 ignition, MSD Pro-Billet Distributor, headers and dual 2.5-inch exhaust with H-pipe Summit Turbo mufflers, Built 904 with 9.5 inch PTC convertor, reverse manual valve-body and Hurst shifter, 8.75 rear with 355 Sure-Grip and Pinion Snubber, QA1 adjustable shocks, 12 gallon fuel cell with Holley Blue pump, .5-inch braided hose, and AN fittings provide plenty of fuel. This car starts up on demand and will run all day without the slightest hint of overheating. Performs like a late-model engine should with strong/quick torque. 

The body was repainted 20 years ago but still remains show-car worthy. It is equipped with a Hurst Pistol Grip Shifter plus a new OEM style ?Bumble Bee? stripe has been added as well as new paint under the hood, new door handles, black vinyl top recently refinished, new custom 15-inch wheels from Specialty Wheel painted body color with new Plymouth dog-dish caps, and new tires. The 430 gears still go with the cars to let it rip. The car has no rust throughout the body and the interior remains in nice original condition. It has a new Legendary front bench cover, original dash, and door panels/headliner remain in great shape. This is an awesome Mopar for the money ? you cannot recreate this car for the price offered here...

Seller's Notes: The Plymouth Cranbrook, as a car, is conservatively styled, designed to fit K.T. Keller's notion that cars be practical and allow drivers to sit upright while wearing a hat; it was sold at a time when competitors favored the low and sleek look. It was also sold at a time when the government had limited the use of a lot of resources, following the end of WWII in 1945 and gearing up for the start of the Korean War, for production that is why this is the year that almost wasn't. Eastern North Carolina's Premier Pre-owned Dealership. Family owned and operated since 1976. The Best Selection and Great service.

Seller's Notes: Our Plymouth Grand Voyager is a Ricon drop floor handicap van with wheelchair handicap lift and power driver swivel seating. She has 91,073 original miles. This particular van is in great shape and the lift works as designed. She has all the factory power options, front and rear air, good tires and is ready to go. These particular vans are very hard to find especially in this price range because of the high cost of converting these vans to be handicap accessible. You will like this van and she is priced to sell. Act quickly and take advantage of our extra special find. For additional information, visit our website at www.libertytrucksales.net or contact Gerald or Freddy at 888-310-0650. Thanks for looking at our ad and your interest in one of our vehicles.

Seller's Notes: Emmons Motor Company has found one of the few ""survivors"" from the Swingin' Sixties! As you drive our 1965 Plymouth Belvedere II sedan and accelerate the V8 engine in this time machine, you will travel back to the JFK days of big cars , men in slim fit suits, and beautiful women. The Belvedere II model was one of the the most popular 4-door sedans with 41,445 models produced that year. As you admire this piece of Detroit history, you too, will be pleasantly surprised at how intact and remarkably good condition the Belvedere badging and chrome trim has lasted all these years. The ORIGINAL Plymouth hubcaps show extremely well surrounded by the new Goodyear Allegra tires. The complete interior appears to be period correct. Whether you are a car collector or someone wanting a cruiser for weekend cars shows or cruise events with the family, this Belvedere II would be an excellent choice. ATTENTION CUSTOMERS!!!

Seller's Notes: Plymouth, one of America's oldest automotive nameplates. The Voyager helped profoundly change the American automotive landscape when it was introduced in late 1983. Unlike other minivans built during this time period, this Voyager doesn't have a stiff, bouncy truck-like ride. Getting in and out of the Voyager is one of the vehicle's best traits and an Easy Out roller rear seat makes it easier to modify the passenger/cargo layout to suit specific needs. With the rear seats out, there is enough room in the back to haul all sorts of camping equipment. Need more reasons to give our Voyager your serious consideration?? Dual sliding doors, rear side windows that open, tight turning radius and built in child seats with lots of window space. Chrysler designed its minivans for functionality and ease of operation. It is very handy whether hauling people or cargo. So- Print this page and call us Now... We Know You Will Enjoy Your Test Drive Towards Ownership! Please Contact Mike Pepping at 888-751-8347 or my cell at 888-751-8347. This vehicle is located at Bettendorf Auto Sales 4219 State Street, Bettendorf, Iowa 52722.

Seller's Notes: 1976 Plymouth Gran Fury - For sale with only 86,662 original miles!! Very cool clean old car. 400 Cubic inch V-8 runs strong, shifts and stops perfect! Everything works including A/C. Cruise control works on and off. Mechanically this Fury is a 9 out of 10. The exterior is also a 9 out of 10. Paint is nice, has a few little bubbles starting down low. Interior is near perfect! I would say a 10 out of 10. 2 owner car and very reliable! Drive it anywhere with no worries. Great car for only $4,499!

Seller's Notes: You are viewing a very nice and clean, 2001 DODGE NEON SEDAN. This is powered with a very smooth and strong running 4 Cylinder engine, the transmission is Automatic. The car has only 91k miles! The engine runs very smooth and the transmission shifts perfect. There are no abnormal sounds from the engine or transmission and the car runs very smooth! The car gets very good gas mileage - about 36MPG on the highway! The car was recently checked out and test driven by our mechanic and no problems were found, we check all cars out before we sell them! We sell only sound cars with good history - buy with confidence! The paint on this vehicle is in good condition except for some small dings and scratches here and there all very minor, the interior is in top shape - I truly can't see any wear. The spare is in the trunk and appears never used, the jack and all other tools are there too, unused as well. The AC blows ICE COLD!!! The car is problem free - buy and drive anywhere!

Seller's Notes: This Voyager Van is in immaculate shape both inside and out. The exterior is flawless, and the inside is perfect. If you are in the market for a clean Mini-Van then know this, it has a clean title, NO accidents, the engine and the transmission are in perfect working order, and it comes with a clean vehicle history report. DO NOT go pay thousands more at any other dealership when this one is priced so competitively. Come take a look and you will not be disappointed! 
People are always asking us how it is that we have the lowest prices, when our vehicles are such high quality and guaranteed with a free vehicle history report. They are NOT branded titles, they do not have accidents. They are top notch quality, pre-owned vehicles that come with the Five Point Auto 7 day quality exchange promise. 
Well its time to reveal the secret, and there are NO gimmicks. We are a family run, locally owned dealership with over 25 years experience in selling autos. We know that earning your business takes quality service on quality vehicles, from a dealership you can trust. Unlike most other dealerships, we own all of our vehicles out right, and that means that we don't have to pay bank flooring costs, fees, or interest on our cars. Because of that, our overhead is low and we pass that savings on to you, our customer, in the extremely low prices that we offer with the vehicle that you want. 
So if you are in the market for a vehicle, before you go and pay thousands more, stop in and let us show you why so many people are switching to the FIVE POINT way of buying their vehicles. 
We are in Layton, UT off of I-15 exit 331. At the BOTTOM of the exit take a left and then take the very first right that you can take, which will be main street. We are up that street a little over a half of a mile on your left hand side, across the street from Les Schwabb Tires and Kohl's Department store.

Seller's Notes: You are viewing a very nice and clean, 2001 DODGE NEON SEDAN. This is powered with a very smooth and strong running 4 Cylinder engine, the transmission is Automatic. The engine runs very smooth and the transmission shifts perfect. There are no abnormal sounds from the engine or transmission and the car runs very smooth! The car gets very good gas mileage - about 36MPG on the highway! The car was recently checked out and test driven by our mechanic and no problems were found, we check all cars out before we sell them! A new water pump and timing belt were just installed. We sell only sound cars with good history - buy with confidence! The paint on this vehicle is in good condition except for some small dings and scratches here and there all very minor, the interior is in top shape - I truly can't see any wear. The spare is in the trunk and appears never used, the jack and all other tools are there too, unused as well - please check the pictures! The car is problem free - buy and drive anywhere!

Seller's Notes: Super clean and just fully serviced Neon Highline sedan finished in Silver over Gray interior and fitted with the ultra fuel efficient yet surprisingly peppy 16V DONC 2.0L 4cyl engine and 5spd manual transmission. This is the upgraded motor for the Neon not to be confused with the less than reliable SOHC 4cyl engine in lesser models. This car is in incredibly clean condition inside and out with no dings, dents, rust, or major scratches to be found on the body anywhere. The interior is super clean as well with no signs of major wear or abuse. The car has just been serviced and inspected in our service department including all new brakes and it also has a set of newer tires all around. If you are looking for a super clean sedan that will return incredible fuel economy and has been fully serviced and inspected, come check out this super clean Neon Highline. Please visit us at our website, www.autolivery.com, for a COMPLETE description of this vehicle, including more pictures, vehicle and warranty info.

Seller's Notes: This is a very nice running, one owner, van that has very low miles. It is equipped with a hydraulic elevator lift to lift a wheel chair in and out of the van. The person can be no taller than 5'6"" to fit through the opening. Once inside, their is a floor lock to keep the chair secure. We do also have the passenger seat if you wish to install it back in the van. I will be happy to answer any additional questions, just give us a call. The van also does come with the wheelchair you see in the pictures. We have been established here since 1957 and have a great reputation in the area. You can also contact us at our direct line, 866-396-9970 and ask for Rich. We will also safety check any car we sell.

Selling Points: This is a classic Fury II, runs great, and has tons of space in it. The interior is original and needs complete reupholstering.The Fury II has approximately 48,600 actual miles on it, [even though the cover sheet of this ad states 53,000, which was my over estimation] and has a good maintenance history, ie: oil changed, belts, etc. There is one dent in tail fin. The color is a very dark blue.In August 2005, it had a new exhaust system installed, new points, plugs, wires and battery! As of fall of 2010, it runs great and will idle for a half hour or more without ever over heating! 

Condition: The body of the car is in very good shape, but needs a new paint job. The interior of the car is original and is in fair condition, definitely needs some classy reupholstering.

Seller's Notes: Plymouth, one of America's oldest automotive nameplates. The Voyager helped profoundly change the American automotive landscape when it was introduced in late 1983. Unlike other minivans built during this time period, 
this Voyager doesn't have a stiff, bouncy truck-like ride. Getting in and out of the Voyager is one of the vehicle's best traits and an ""Easy Out"" roller rear seat makes it easier to modify the passenger/cargo layout to suit specific needs. With the rear seats out, there is enough room in the back to haul all sorts of camping equipment. 

Need more reasons to give our Voyager your serious consideration?? Dual sliding doors, rear side windows that open, tight turning radius and built in child seats with lots of window space. 
Chrysler designed its minivans for functionality and ease of operation. It is very handy whether hauling people or cargo. So- Print this page and call us Now... We Know You Will Enjoy Your Test Drive Towards Ownership!

Seller's Notes: No trip is too far, nor will it be too boring.. CONTACT THE INTERNET SALES DEPARMENT FOR ALL QUESTIONS. It takes more than just selling large numbers of vehicles to be Texas' #1 Volume Five-Star dealer: no matter how many vehicles you sell, unless your customers tell Chrysler you're the greatest, you can't be Five-Star. We work harder to make sure your every experience with us is the best, whether it's in Sales, Service, Finance or Parts.

Selling Points: Bought van brand new. Served us well for 13 years, but time has come to say goodbye. Van had almost daily use. Long trips many times without issue. Has minor dings and scratches (see photos). Pretty good condition for its age. I did routine maintenance, changing oil and brake pads. Documented other maintenance I could not do myself (details upon request). Current tires have plenty of tread. Easy to remove rear seats. Can haul a good amount. Tried to be realistic but fair on price. If theres any info at all I can provide that will prevent you from wasting your time, Ill do whatever I can to help. Will only deal w/direct buyer (no dealers, no ""relatives""). I sign over title w/price and insist you sign it at same time. I will hand over title upon receipt of check (allows you to get temp tags) but will keep van until check clears. Once you have temp tags, its all yours. (Sorry, been swindled B4.) 

Condition: I wish to be completely up front about all issues that may affect purchase decision. For other specific questions, please call. I will answer any question to avoid wasting your time. Power lock on the right sliding door does not work. Could be problem with actuator. For past two summers, I added about 3 cans of R134a coolant due to slow leak in the A/C system. That gets us through one Maryland summer. Coolant is under $20/can. $60/year cheaper than paying $1000 to get the leak fixed. (Please note that this is a detail I could easily have ""neglected"" to mention.) For questions or to arrange a test drive, please contact me (Jeff) at 2404012683 any time between the hours of 8 AM to 9 PM Eastern.

Selling Points: This minivan was purchased ""brand new"" in 1995 and comes with all maintenance records. The red exterior (with luggage rack) is in good condition considering its 17 years old and has 285,000 miles on it. The interior is also in decent condition. All side windows and back window are tinted. Althought the van needs some amount of mechanical attention, I believe it still has a few good years left in it. The van will be sold ""AS IS"" and the sale will be final. While the asking price is $675, that price is negotiable within reason. All reasonable offers will be considered.

Seller's Notes: Visit our website http://www.richardbellautosales.com/ for more information and photos on this or any of our other vehicles or call us today for a test drive at 888-517-4373.You are looking at a 1967 Plymouth Satellite with a Big Block v8 440 engine. This baby is a monster on the road. It has a LOUD set of duals on it that rumble and turn heads. The engine is beefed up with a nice hefty camshaft and a nice carb. The automatic transmission shifts very strong but is set up for drag racing where you pull it back to shift in reverse order 3=1 2=2 and 1=3. It has a nice set of alloy rims with a good set of rubber all the way around. It has a nice set of sunpro guages mounted under the dash. It is in very good shape and ready to hit the road or strip. The vehicle went through a recent restoration, it used to be red. We put it back to the color it was in the video and did some work on the interior. She is turn key, ready to go.
