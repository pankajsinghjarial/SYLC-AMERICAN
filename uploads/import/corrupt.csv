Seller's Notes: Here's what the experts are saying! The sportronic manual shift feature works great and offers more involvement for driving enthusiasts. The design is beautiful with a more muscular appearence due to wider flared wheel arches and a crimped mid section. The new waterfall grille and chrome trimmed fog lamps make for a real head turning front fascia! Regal looks alot more expensive that what i paid for it. The car looks amazing in motion or parked in the driveway. I am asked all the time what kind of car it is and whether it was expensive. The Regal out classes any car i can think of for $28K. The list of standard eqip is long, design and craftsmanship are excellent inside and out. The blue interior lighting is unique and easy to read, day or night. The leather apointed interior and firm seats welcome the driver and passengers alike. The ergonomics are well thought out, everything seems to be right at your fingertips, no hunting or searching for features and settings. Great car, good looks, comfort, safety, VALUE!

Seller's Notes: This 2011 Buick Regal CXL is offered to you for sale by Freeman Buick GMC. Adjectives like impeccable, spotless, and immaculate could be used to describe how clean this Regal CXL is, causing it to feel more like a new vehicle than a pre-owned one. The Regal CXL will provide you with everything you have always wanted in a car -- Quality, Reliability, and Character. A truly breathtaking example of pure vehicle design achievement...this is the vehicle of your dreams! More information about the 2011 Buick Regal: The Regal is sized slightly smaller than mainstream mid-size sedans like the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord or Nissan Altima but a little larger than mid-size performance/luxury sedans like the Acura TSX or Volvo S60. At a price that's well below those premium brand sedans, GM is pitching the Buick-especially the performance-oriented GS-as a sporty alternative. That said, with a very full range of standard convenience and safety features, plus a fashionable new look, the Regal CXL is safe and sporty, yet still comfortable, alternative for families who see the mainstream offerings as a little too boring. Interesting features of this model are nicely detailed interior, stronger, more fuel-efficient 4-cylinder engines, performance-tuned GS model, Sporty styling, and value pricing for lots of standard features Ask for ZACK or WADE when you get here for an extra bonus! 888-858-4973 !
