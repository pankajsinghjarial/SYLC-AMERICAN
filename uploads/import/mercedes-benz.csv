Selling Points: A rare find. This is the 16valve 2.3 litre Cosworth engine, 5speed transmission, light champagne color. Only about 2000 of these cars were imported, all in 19861987 and less than half had manual transmissions. I bought this car twelve years ago and have driven it less than 10,000 miles never in the snow or even the rain. Always garaged. The engine was completely rebuilt by a Mercedestrained mechanic shortly after I bought it.I dont drive the car enough to justify keeping it. Email me for more information. 

Condition: Excellent condition no rust, no cracks in dash, no wear on the leather. Rebuilt engine runs a little rough needs a good Mercedes specialist to tune it. I live in upstate NY and did not have the A/C reconnected during the rebuilding.

Seller's Notes: This one-owner, very low mileage 2008 Mercedes-Benz CLK63 Black Series is one you don't want to miss. It came to us from a client looking for a Porsche and had an original MSRP was $138,375. The racetrack-inspired CLK63 AMG Black Series coupe joined the lineup in 2008. It boasts a 500-horsepower 6.2-liter V8 along with a track-ready suspension, upgraded composite brakes, seriously supportive front seats. It is capable of launching from 0-60 in a mere 4.4 seconds. Only 350 were slated for delivery to the U.S. market. The Black Series coupe is the closest thing to a track car you can get from Mercedes, as it has a manually adjustable suspension, revised steering geometry, massive composite brakes (with six-piston front rotors), heavily bolstered sport seats and no backseat (deleted to save weight). This rare bird also features unique styling tweaks such as front fender vents and aggressive wheel arch flares. This vehicle comes with a Mercedes-Benz Certified Pre-Owned Warranty. This means that this vehicle has met Mercedes-Benz strict eligibility criteria and has passed their rigorous certification process. You will receive the benefit of a comprehensive limited warranty, 24-hour roadside assistance and nationwide dealer support. Contact a Sales specialist by calling 888-569-4580. Isringhausen Imports is Central Illinois' premier new car, used car and certified pre-owned (CPO) dealership for quality Mercedes-Benz new and used vehicles. Looking to buy used cars? Isringhausen Imports is the place to go for quality new cars and used cars for sale.

Seller's Notes: This is a one-owner 2009 Mercedes-Benz CLK350 convertible with an original MSRP of $62,565. The convertible version of the CLK maintains clean lines, especially when its traditional cloth top is retracted. There is also no shortage of power in the 2009 CLK350 with over 260 horsepower. And in true Mercedes-Benz tradition it offers a solid chassis, a composed ride, comfortable front seats, and fast power top operation. Safety is not limited either with stability control, antilock disc brakes with brake assist, active front head restraints, and pop-up roll bars (that automatically deploy in a rollover) located behind the rear seats which are all standard. Optional features of this CLK350 include: Premium 1 Package, Appearance Package, Bluetooth hands-free communication kit, wood/leather steering wheel, DVD COMAND Navigation, Burl Walnut Wood trim, and heated front seats.

Seller's Notes: Desert European Motorcars Ltd. is honored to present a wonderful example of pure vehicle design... this 2008 Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class CLK350 only has 37,408 miles on it and could potentially be the vehicle of your dreams! With adjectives like sporty, classy, and downright indulgent to describe the 2008 CLK-Class CLK350, you'll love every minute of owning and driving this convertible. You may never go back to a closed-cabin car! This CLK-Class CLK350's level of quality meant for the person who strives for a classy, comfortable, and luxurious car. The CLK-Class CLK350 is well maintained and has just 37,408 miles. This low amount of miles makes this vehicle incomparable to the competition. More information about the 2008 Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class: With the exception of the high-performance 2008 CLK63 AMG Black Series, the Mercedes-Benz CLK Class coupes and convertibles are luxurious mid-size two-doors that prioritize comfort and interior appointments above overt sportiness. The models have generously proportioned, supportive front seats across the line, while even the CLK convertible is a rarity among drop-tops as a true four-seater, with enough space for two in back. Both of the CLK63 AMG models-especially the Black Series-offer a different, more exclusive equipment set, with scorching, track-ready performance without a big sacrifice in comfort. Interesting features of this model are otherworldly performance (AMG models), Awash in comfort, luxury powerhouse, convertible models boast a legitimate back seat., and smooth ride

Seller's Notes: Florida Auto Gallery is proud to present this LOW MILEAGE 2009 Mercedes CLK 550 convertible. This is a very clean, two-owner Florida vehicle with a certified clean CARFAX report. Luxury is syonymous with Mercedes, and this CLK lives up to that name and will surely not disappoint. This Mercedes convertible comes loaded with features and amenities, including the high-demand color combination of the CAPRI BLUE METALLIC exterior with the STONE leather interior trim with BLUE soft top. This 2009 Mercedes CLK 550 convertible is propelled by a 5.5-liter V8 engine that produces a healthy 382 hp and 391 lb-ft of torque. The seven-speed automatic transmission provides butter-smooth shifts exactly when they're needed. The CLK 550's structural rigidity, combined with front and rear double wishbone independent suspension helps provide a wonderfully smooth ride. The steering is solid and precise, creating a tangible connection to the road and the CLK's four-wheel disc brakes with ABS ensure true stops. The interior maintains the elegant, modern simplicity of the exterior. The cockpit is filled with real wood and rich leather appointments. Our entire inventory at Florida Auto Gallery is hand selected, freshly serviced and fully documented including complimentary CARFAX and vehicle history reports.

Seller's Notes: Mercedes-Benz of Freehold presents this 2008 MERCEDES-BENZ CLK-CLASS 2DR CABRIOLET 5.5L with just 30902 miles. Represented in BLACK and complimented nicely by its BLACK PREMIUM LEATHE interior. Fuel Efficiency comes in at 21 highway and 15 city. Under the hood you will find the 5.5L DOHC 32-valve V8 engine coupled with the AUTOMATIC. Recently reduced to $33925 and at $135 below Kelly Blue Book, this vehicle is priced competitively and below the published market valuation. The Word Around Town: With the exception of the high-performance 2008 CLK63 AMG Black Series, the Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class coupes and convertibles are luxurious mid-size two-doors that prioritize comfort and interior appointments above overt sportiness. The models have generously proportioned, supportive front seats across the line, while even the CLK convertible is a rarity among drop-tops as a true four-seater, with enough space for two in back. Both of the CLK63 AMG models--especially the Black Series--offer a different, more exclusive equipment set, with scorching, track-ready performance without a big sacrifice in comfort. Options and Safety Features: Nicely equipped with 3-point front seat belts w/emergency tensioning devices, adaptive belt force limiters, 3-point rear seat belts w/emergency tensioning devices, belt force limiters, Anti-lock braking system (ABS) w/brake assist system, Automatic rollover-sensing pop-up roll bars, Driver & front passenger dual-stage adaptive airbags w/front passenger occupancy classification system, Driver & front passenger head & thorax airbags, Electronic Stability Program (ESP), Illuminated emergency interior trunk release, Programmable daytime running lamps w/auto override, Universal LATCH system (Lower Anchors & Tethers for Children) at rear seating positions and CONVERTIBLE/NAVIGATION/SOFT TOP HARMON KARDON SOUND W/DOLBY 5.1 SIRIUS SATELLITE RADIO/6-CD CHNGR. At Mercedes-Benz of Freehold, you can be sure that your experience is our #1 priority.
